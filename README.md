### Mapping Values to Projections in the Spatial Domain via the Application of Latent Dirichlet Allocation to Text Data from the Time Domain


#### Abstract:
We investigate the application of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to alumni survey answers to the question:  “From the perspective you have gained since graduation, what do you especially value about your undergraduate experience at this institution?” 

LDA is a machine learning algorithm used to discover the underlying topics in text data. Our subject reflects the relationships between the person and Cooper Union, and between LDA and the programmer.

Once the text is processed through LDA, the algorithm generates a set of inferences. These outputs are manifested through four main elements: an electric bulb or other light source, a reflector and "condensing" lens to direct the light to the surface, a holder, and a focusing lens. When projected onto the wall or desired surface, the perimeter of each image is traced with a thin line of latex paint.
